						<h2>About</h2>
						<p style="font-size: 15px;"> It seems that whenever I’m asked to describe myself, it often tends to default toward a conversation centering around my education. No, I did not have any plans to become a history teacher. Rather, my degree reflects a longstanding relationship with writing. I have always enjoyed being given space to find the <s>perfect</s> appropriate sequence of words; as if my thoughts are a puzzle that has yet to be pieced together. Nonetheless, I’d still prefer to talk over coffee. I usually like mine iced.
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p style="font-size: 15px;"> My history degree especially makes sense when considering my love for vintage objects. Notably, vintage clothing is a huge passion of mine. I try and source pieces myself, but when that gets difficult, I like to get out and support my local community whenever there happens to be a market event nearby. Furthermore, my appreciation for mid-century interior design has only continued to grow since adopting the responsibility over the furnishings of my living space. It's hard to imagine that I could ever get tired of the geometric cleanliness that makes up a good Bauhaus chair.</p>
