						<h2>About</h2>
						<p style="font-size: 14px;"> It seems that whenever asked to describe myself, my education is the inital defining aspect. I did not have any plans to become a history teacher, sorry. Instead, my degree reflects a continued advancement in my writing capabilities. I have always enjoyed being given space to find the <s>perfect</s> appropriate sequence of words, but I still prefer to talk over coffee. I like mine iced.
						<p style="font-size: 14px;"> A history degree especially makes sense when considering my love for vintage objects. Since taking up some more responsibility for the furnishings of my living space, my appreciation for mid-century interior design has only continued to grow. I love a good Bauhaus-style chair. Vintage clothing is also notably a huge passion of mine. I try and source pieces myself, but when that gets difficult, I like to support my local community whenever there happens to be a pop-up market. Much of the value within these communities derives from the passionate conversations among people with a shared interest, and I am always looking for the next one. Please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out so that we can get the next one started. Thanks.</p>
